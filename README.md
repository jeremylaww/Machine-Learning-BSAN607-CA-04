CA04 â€“ Ensemble Models is an assignment that involves building, evaluating, and comparing the performance of four ensemble classifiers - Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGB, on a dataset obtained from the Census Bureau. The dataset has 48,842 instances with seven attributes, and the target variable represents whether a person earns more than 50K or not.

The assignment has six sections, starting with data sourcing and cleaning. In section 2, the optimal value of the number of estimators for ensemble classifiers is found by plotting graphs of accuracy and AUC vs. n_estimators. Section 3 involves building a Random Forest model, and section 4 repeats the process for AdaBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGB classifiers.

In section 5, the performance of the four models is compared based on the best values of accuracy and AUC obtained in the previous steps.

The required Python libraries to run this program are pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and xgboost. Make sure to install these libraries before running the notebook.
